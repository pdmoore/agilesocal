<h3>
Product Visioning in the Agile World: Why You Need a Coherent Vision to Drive your Product Backlog and How to Create It</h3>
<p>
Nike&#39;s <q>Just Do It!</q> slogan could easily be mistaken for an agile mantra. Quickly jumping into writing user stores to get the delivery team working on a backlog as quickly as possible is the way to go, right? Actually, no, not really! Coming up with user stories for the latest &lsquo;hot&#8217; product fads with minimal thought results in creating an ad-hoc mix of user stories that looks like a &lsquo;feature soup&#8217;! This makes delivering business value aligned with key business drivers a hit or miss proposition, which makes for some rather unhappy business stakeholders and customers. It also bleeds energy and focus away from the delivery team, who can&#39;t see a unifying purpose in the stories that they deliver.<br />
What can product owners do to focus and energize their delivery teams and make sure the backlog has stories that deliver the mega bang for their megabucks?<br />
Enter the concept of <q>Product Vision</q>, an idea that was quite popular in the pre-agile days but has more often than not fallen by the wayside in the rush to scrum! Discover why it&#39;s crucial for the product owner to work with business stakeholders and the delivery team to create a coherent product vision, before they create a product backlog, and how to go about it.<br />
In this presentation, you&#39;ll learn why it&#39;s critical to start with the end in mind, why a coherent and compelling product vision makes such a difference and how exactly to go about it. You&#39;ll discover proven techniques for creating a product vision, from a product vision box to a vision board, and more! Chances are after attending this presentation, and being armed with these tools, you&#39;ll never be able to kickoff an agile project again without crafting a coherent vision first!
